- Finish renderer refactor, tidy up D3d11 and D3D12 back-ends.

- Move static world geometry rendering to use vertex buffers instead of submitting every frame.
  MD2s can stay as they are for now and get regenerated and sumitted per-frame with the MiniImBatch.

- Implement lighting with point lights, ambient and maybe spot lights.

- Implement shadow maps for shadows.

- Look into some form of automated bump mapping/normal mapping (generate the bump maps from the existing colour textures).
  Nothing fancy, but might give it a cooler look.
  
- Look into ways of improving the particle systems used by the game. They are pretty rough quads in the original quake!

- Make bullet hits in the walls leave a damage decal.

- Do some CPU profiling with Optick (brofiler)!
